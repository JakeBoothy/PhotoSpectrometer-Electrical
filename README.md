# PhotoSpectrometer-Electrical
PCB Design for my visible photospectrometer.

## Version 1

Version 1 was completed for a class project. It performed reasonably well but had a mistake and left out some much needed features. The files are here for reference but it is not recommended that you build it.

## Version 2

I am working on version 2 right now. There is more info on my website but I am cleaning up the design and adding some more features.

* Peltier drivers
* Better amplifier design
* Change microcontroller to STM32
* TFT Screen and encoder
* External ADC
* SD Card
* And much more!

Additionally I am going to do a full optical design with raytracing software and a full mechanical redesign. 

Design was done in eagle.
